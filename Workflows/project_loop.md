  <purpose>
    Maintain autonomous project execution until the <optimized_project_goal> is fully realized, ensuring no context loss and dynamic adaptation throughout the process.
  </purpose>

  <instructions>
    1. After each task is marked as completed in <file>context/tasks.md</file>:
      a. Use the <search> tool to re-read <file>context/optimized_project_goal.md</file>, <file>context/inbounds.md</file>, <file>context/outerbounds.md</file>, and <file>context/tasks.md</file> to refresh context.
      b. Engage UltraThink: Analyze whether the <optimized_project_goal> is now fully satisfied, referencing all context files and the current state of the project.
      c. If any gaps, missing requirements, or new tasks are identified, add them to <file>context/tasks.md</file> (clearly noting if added by the agent) and continue execution.
      d. If a task cannot be completed, UltraThink about possible resolutions (clarify, split, rephrase, or escalate) and update <file>context/tasks.md</file> accordingly.
    2. The loop ends only when:
      a. All tasks in <file>context/tasks.md</file> are marked as completed.
      b. UltraThink confirms, with reference to <optimized_project_goal> and <inbounds>, that the project is fully realized and no further tasks are required.
      c. Optionally, execute a final "project review" task to audit deliverables against <optimized_project_goal> and <inbounds>.
    3. If you create any temporary files or artifacts during this process, clean them up at the end of the task.
  </instructions>

  <formatting>
    - When adding new tasks, clearly note they were "added by agent" for traceability.
    - When marking a task as completed, prefix the line with "[x] ".
    - Do not remove completed tasks; keep the full history in <file>context/tasks.md</file>.
    - Do not include any preamble, summary, or explanation in the output filesâ€”only the updated list of tasks.
  </formatting>

  <examples>
    <tasks>

      Develop a personalized budgeting module that adapts to user-defined financial goals.
      Integrate secure authentication. (added by agent)

  <quality>
    - After each loop, review for completeness, maintainability, and alignment with <optimized_project_goal> and <inbounds>.
    - Ensure <file>context/tasks.md</file> is always up to date and accurately reflects the current state of the project.
    - Maintain clear, actionable, and traceable records of progress and agent decisions.
